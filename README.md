This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: using raw pointers to modify a vector in a way that violates Rust's memory safety guarantees. The original code modifies the first element of the vector via a raw pointer, but this results in undefined behavior if the vector's length changes. The solution shows the correct way to safely modify the vector's contents using vector methods.
